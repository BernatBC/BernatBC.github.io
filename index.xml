I will update them soon. The project After making the Minesweeper, I wanted to create something more elaborated. I decided to make a clone of Monopoly. Almost everybody has played at least one time to Monopoly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to make an introduction.
How it works I started with the player movement and the dice. When everything was smooth and playable, I started to make the cards.</description></item><item><title>LocalSearch</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/localsearch/</guid><description>The statement Given a set of Power plants and Clients, find an assignation for each Client where the total benefit is the maximum. Each power plant is represented by coordinates in a map, the total production and the cost when it&amp;rsquo;s stopped and running. Each client is represented by coordinates in a map, the power consumed, the price it pays for each Mw and a compensation in the case he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get power.</description></item><item><title>Vintè Concurs de Programació de la UPC - Semifinal 2022</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/20concursupc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/20concursupc/</guid><description>About the contest Each year, School of Mathematics and Statistics from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya organizes a coding competition for all students enrolled to UPC. During 4 hours, the contestants try to solve as many coding problems as possible. A rank is made considering the number of solved problems and penalization points. For each wrong submission, they add 20 minutes to the total of time used for each solved problem. So the sooner you solve them, the better.</description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2022</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</guid><description>About Google Hash Code Google Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. It allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs.</description></item><item><title>Minesweeper</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/</guid><description>The project Before making this project, I&amp;rsquo;d used Unity game engine for making a couple of games like Tetris by following some Youtube tutorials. Also, I made Space Shooter during HackUPC2021, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my own. Now I wanted to do a project on my own and decided to start with a simple game. Minesweeper was a good candidate as it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too complex. I didn&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and made a clone of minesweeper.</description></item><item><title>HackUPC 2021</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</guid><description>About HackUPC HackUPC is the first student hackathon in Spain. Once a year, we aim to provide a space for students of all experience levels from all around the world where they can improve and learn new skills, meet awesome people, and overall have a great experience! This year&amp;rsquo;s edition will be held in a hybrid format, meaning that you can come in person but also participate from home.
Our project @miquelt9, @JCasahuga and I decided to participate in this hackathon in the first year of the degree.</description></item><item><title>Google Code Jam 2021</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/codejam2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/codejam2021/</guid><description>About Google Code Jam Google’s longest running global coding competition, Google Code Jam, calls on programmers around the world to solve challenging, algorithmic puzzles against the clock.
