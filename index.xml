We were asked to implement four different algorithms. Two using tracking techniques, and two using recognition. For each technique, we had to implement one from scratch (an algorithm made for us) and another one extracted from the internet.
Given a series of frames and a bounding box corresponding to the object to track, the algorithm should follow the object.</description></item><item><title>λ-Calculus Telegram Bot</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</guid><description>The statement We were asked to make a lambda-calculus interpreter created by Alonzo Church. This interpreter had also to support the definition and use of macros, a variable name for another expression. Those macros had to be evaluated in an infix (if it&amp;rsquo;s a symbol) or a prefix mode (otherwise). On top of that, our interpreter had to run in a Telegram chat. Finally, we had to add the capability to print our expression as a tree in an image.</description></item><item><title>Royal Hackaway v6</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</guid><description>About Royal Hackaway Royal Hackaway is Royal Holloway&amp;rsquo;s annual hackathon. Open to students from all around the world, in this two-day hackathon you&amp;rsquo;ll work as a team to build a project. You&amp;rsquo;ll pick up new skills, try out new tech, and meet new people.
This is our sixth time running this event, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to create a more inclusive and rewarding event for all. You can join us in-person, or online!</description></item><item><title>Document manager</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/documentmanager/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/documentmanager/</guid><description>The statement The Programming Projects college subject asked us to create an application to manage documents using Java. This application has to feature the creation of a document, importing and exporting files in three different formats: plaintext, XML and our own format. The application also has to have the ability to delete and modify these documents. The main feature of the application is the various document queries that allow us to find a certain document or author in the application.</description></item><item><title>Planification project</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/planification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/planification/</guid><description>The statement We are in the year 2075 and the first colonizers of Mars have established a network of bases throughout the geography of the planet that can be of two types, settlements (where the settlers live) and warehouses (where supplies arrive from the Earth). Moving between these bases is done by rovers that can move supplies and specialized personnel. It is not possible to always go directly from one base to another, we have a map (connected graph) that tells us which movements are possible.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Based Systems</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</guid><description>The statement The progressive aging of the population is showing the importance of maintaining a set of healthy habits and promote physical exercise throughout life. When you reach a certain age it is necessary to have help to determine what types of exercises and activities are the most appropriate taking into account all factors that may affect the performance of those activities.
Basically, we had to make a CLIPS script that after given certain information about a person, we had to output an exercise planning suitable for him/her.</description></item><item><title>Monopoly</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/monopoly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 06:00:22 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/monopoly/</guid><description>The project After making the Minesweeper, I wanted to create something more elaborated. I decided to make a clone of Monopoly. Almost everybody has played at least one time to Monopoly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to make an introduction.
How it works I started with the player movement and the dice. When everything was smooth and playable, I started to make the cards. One thing I like about them is the fact that they aren&amp;rsquo;t images.</description></item><item><title>Local Search</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/localsearch/</guid><description>The statement Given a set of Power plants and Clients, find an assignation for each Client where the total benefit is the maximum. Each power plant is represented by coordinates in a map, the total production and the cost when it&amp;rsquo;s stopped and running. Each client is represented by coordinates in a map, the power consumed, the price it pays for each Mw and a compensation in the case he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get power.</description></item><item><title>Vintè Concurs de Programació de la UPC - Semifinal 2022</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/20concursupc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/20concursupc/</guid><description>About the contest Each year, School of Mathematics and Statistics from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya organizes a coding competition for all students enrolled to UPC. During 4 hours, the contestants try to solve as many coding problems as possible. A rank is made considering the number of solved problems and penalization points. For each wrong submission, they add 20 minutes to the total of time used for each solved problem. So the sooner you solve them, the better.</description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2022</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</guid><description>About Google Hash Code Google Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. It allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge!

Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs.</description></item><item><title>Minesweeper</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/</guid><description>The project Before making this project, I&amp;rsquo;d used Unity game engine for making a couple of games like Tetris by following some Youtube tutorials. Also, I made Space Shooter during HackUPC2021, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my own. Now I wanted to do a project on my own and decided to start with a simple game. Minesweeper was a good candidate as it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too complex. I didn&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and made a clone of minesweeper.</description></item><item><title>HackUPC 2021</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</guid><description>About HackUPC HackUPC is the first student hackathon in Spain.
