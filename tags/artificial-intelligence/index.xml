We were asked to implement four different algorithms. Two using tracking techniques, and two using recognition. For each technique, we had to implement one from scratch (an algorithm made for us) and another one extracted from the internet.
Given a series of frames and a bounding box corresponding to the object to track, the algorithm should follow the object.</description></item><item><title>Royal Hackaway v6</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</guid><description>About Royal Hackaway Royal Hackaway is Royal Holloway&amp;rsquo;s annual hackathon. Open to students from all around the world, in this two-day hackathon you&amp;rsquo;ll work as a team to build a project. You&amp;rsquo;ll pick up new skills, try out new tech, and meet new people.
This is our sixth time running this event, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to create a more inclusive and rewarding event for all. You can join us in-person, or online!</description></item><item><title>Planification project</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/planification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/planification/</guid><description>The statement We are in the year 2075 and the first colonizers of Mars have established a network of bases throughout the geography of the planet that can be of two types, settlements (where the settlers live) and warehouses (where supplies arrive from the Earth). Moving between these bases is done by rovers that can move supplies and specialized personnel. It is not possible to always go directly from one base to another, we have a map (connected graph) that tells us which movements are possible.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Based Systems</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</guid><description>The statement The progressive aging of the population is showing the importance of maintaining a set of healthy habits and promote physical exercise throughout life. When you reach a certain age it is necessary to have help to determine what types of exercises and activities are the most appropriate taking into account all factors that may affect the performance of those activities.
Basically, we had to make a CLIPS script that after given certain information about a person, we had to output an exercise planning suitable for him/her.</description></item><item><title>Local Search</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/localsearch/</guid><description>The statement Given a set of Power plants and Clients, find an assignation for each Client where the total benefit is the maximum. Each power plant is represented by coordinates in a map, the total production and the cost when it&amp;rsquo;s stopped and running. Each client is represented by coordinates in a map, the power consumed, the price it pays for each Mw and a compensation in the case he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get power.</description></item></channel></rss>
