&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://amoudgl.github.io/tlp/">Long-Term Visual Object Tracking Benchmark&lt;/a> is a dataset to benchmark object tracking algorithms. We were asked to implement four different algorithms. Two using tracking techniques, and two using recognition. For each technique, we had to implement one from scratch (an algorithm made for us) and another one extracted from the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given a series of frames and a bounding box corresponding to the object to track, the algorithm should follow the object. To evaluate the precision, we used the overlapping ratio between the computed bounding box and the optimal bounding box (which was given via a txt file).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
