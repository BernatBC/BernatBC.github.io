This interpreter had also to support the definition and use of macros, a variable name for another expression. Those macros had to be evaluated in an infix (if it&amp;rsquo;s a symbol) or a prefix mode (otherwise). On top of that, our interpreter had to run in a Telegram chat. Finally, we had to add the capability to print our expression as a tree in an image.</description></item></channel></rss>
