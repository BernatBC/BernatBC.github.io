Abstract Since the arrival of the photographic camera, humans have seen the need to find a way to organize photographs. Nowadays, the ease and simplicity of taking a photograph causes large quantities of them to accumulate. The most popular photo viewers and galleries display one image after another, in a list or grid, making it difficult to organize and searching them.</description></item><item><title>Object Tracker</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/objecttracker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/objecttracker/</guid><description>The statement Long-Term Visual Object Tracking Benchmark is a dataset to benchmark object tracking algorithms. We were asked to implement four different algorithms. Two using tracking techniques, and two using recognition. For each technique, we had to implement one from scratch (an algorithm made for us) and another one extracted from the internet.
Given a series of frames and a bounding box corresponding to the object to track, the algorithm should follow the object.</description></item><item><title>Î»-Calculus Telegram Bot</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</guid><description>The statement We were asked to make a lambda-calculus interpreter created by Alonzo Church. This interpreter had also to support the definition and use of macros, a variable name for another expression. Those macros had to be evaluated in an infix (if it&amp;rsquo;s a symbol) or a prefix mode (otherwise). On top of that, our interpreter had to run in a Telegram chat. Finally, we had to add the capability to print our expression as a tree in an image.</description></item><item><title>Document manager</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/documentmanager/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/documentmanager/</guid><description>The statement The Programming Projects college subject asked us to create an application to manage documents using Java. This application has to feature the creation of a document, importing and exporting files in three different formats: plaintext, XML and our own format. The application also has to have the ability to delete and modify these documents. The main feature of the application is the various document queries that allow us to find a certain document or author in the application.</description></item><item><title>Planification project</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/planification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/planification/</guid><description>The statement We are in the year 2075 and the first colonizers of Mars have established a network of bases throughout the geography of the planet that can be of two types, settlements (where the settlers live) and warehouses (where supplies arrive from the Earth). Moving between these bases is done by rovers that can move supplies and specialized personnel. It is not possible to always go directly from one base to another, we have a map (connected graph) that tells us which movements are possible.</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Based Systems</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</guid><description>The statement The progressive aging of the population is showing the importance of maintaining a set of healthy habits and promote physical exercise throughout life. When you reach a certain age it is necessary to have help to determine what types of exercises and activities are the most appropriate taking into account all factors that may affect the performance of those activities.
Basically, we had to make a CLIPS script that after given certain information about a person, we had to output an exercise planning suitable for him/her.</description></item><item><title>Local Search</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/localsearch/</guid><description>The statement Given a set of Power plants and Clients, find an assignation for each Client where the total benefit is the maximum. Each power plant is represented by coordinates in a map, the total production and the cost when it&amp;rsquo;s stopped and running. Each client is represented by coordinates in a map, the power consumed, the price it pays for each Mw and a compensation in the case he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get power.</description></item></channel></rss>
