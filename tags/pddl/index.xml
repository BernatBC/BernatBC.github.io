&lt;p>We are in the year 2075 and the first colonizers of Mars have established a network of bases throughout the geography of the planet that can be of two types, settlements (where the settlers live) and warehouses (where supplies arrive from the Earth). Moving between these bases is done by rovers that can move supplies and specialized personnel. It is not possible to always go directly from one base to another, we have a map (connected graph) that tells us which movements are possible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
