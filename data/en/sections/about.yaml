# a summary about you
summary: "I am a student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. During my free time I compete in coding competitions like [Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/), etc. I also develop videogames using [Unity](https://unity.com) game engine for fun. \n\n Years a go when I was a kid I started my journey by making some little projects using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Soon I realized that [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) was too basic and started to use [Unity](https://unity.com) by following some tutorials on youtube. At that age I felt it was too complex and decided to set it aside. During highschool I coursed a couple subjects related with programing. One of them we made a website using HTML and php. The other one we learnt some programming using [lego mindstorms](https://www.lego.com/en-es/themes/mindstorms) robots. We started implementing simple actions like making the robot to follow a line on the ground and evolved it to a maze solver. The final project was a competition among all calssmates where we had to build a sumo robot. Along my class partner we managed to beign runners up in this competition. The last unit of this subject we made an introduction to [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). We made basic projects like making a LED turn on depending on the amount of light the sensor gets. At home I also have an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board, and haven't made any intermediate level project. Durig my last year on highschool I decided to start over using [Unity](https://unity.com) and followed more youtube tutorials. On college after learning serious programming knowledge I felt more confident and made some little videogames on my own with [Unity](https://unity.com)."
