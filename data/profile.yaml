# A detailed summary about the user
bio: "I am a cybersecurity software engineer at [Build38](https://build38.com/) developing a security SDK to protect various apps. In my day to day, I use C to program the core SDK, as well as some Java, Kotlin, Swift and Flutter for creating wrappers that help integrate the SDK to costumer apps. \n\n I am also a student pursuing a masters degree in Computer Engineering at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/). During my free time I compete in coding competitions like [Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/), [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/), etc. I also develop video games using [Unity](https://unity.com) game engine for fun. \n\n Years ago when I was a kid I started my journey by making some little projects using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Soon I realized that [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) was too basic and started to use [Unity](https://unity.com) by following some tutorials on Youtube. At that age I felt it was too complex and decided to set it aside. During high school I coursed a couple subjects related with programming. One of them we made a website using HTML and PHP. The other one we learnt some programming using [Lego Mindstorms](https://www.lego.com/en-es/themes/mindstorms) robots. We started implementing simple actions like making the robot to follow a line on the ground and evolved it to a maze solver. The final project was a competition among all classmates where we had to build a sumo robot. Along my class partner, we managed to being runners-up in this competition. The last unit of this subject we made an introduction to [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). We made basic projects like making a LED turn on depending on the amount of light the sensor gets. At home, I also have an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) board, and haven't made any intermediate level project. During my last year on high school I decided to start over using [Unity](https://unity.com) and followed more Youtube tutorials. On college after learning serious programming knowledge I felt more confident and made some little video games on my own with [Unity](https://unity.com)."
