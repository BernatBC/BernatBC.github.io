## About Google Hash Code
[Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode) is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. It allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us for the virtual World Finals.

## The problem
You are given a list of contributors, who have already mastered various skills, and a list of projects with different skill requirements. Contributors can improve their skills by completing projects and can mentor each other to work is roles in which they couldn't succeed on their own. Your task is to assign contributors to project roles that fit their qualifications and maximize the score for completed projects. 

For more details please check the [problem statement](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode/round/00000000008caae7/000000000098afc8).


## Our submission
The team was composed with [@miquelt9](https://github.com/miquelt9), [@alexland7219](https://github.com/alexland7219) and myself, three friends studying Computer Science at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. After some brainstorming we decided to attempt to fill the first project available with lowest skilled contribuitors. As soon a project has finalized the contribuitors are assigned to the first project available that they can fit in. After some debugging we decided to generate our submittion files. Little did we know that they were taking forever. We were the three of us using 100% of our CPUs and waiting for the last minute to submit the files. Luckily when submitting partial files, score is still computed. At the end we ended with partial sumbitions.

You can check our algorithm alongside the submittion files in my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>Github repository](https://github.com/BernatBC/Coding-Competitions/tree/main/GoogleHashCode2022).

In the end with our partial submittion we obtained 1,477,643 points positioning ourselves in 3259 out of 10100-10200, a little better than in 2021.
