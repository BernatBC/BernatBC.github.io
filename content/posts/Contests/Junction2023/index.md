## About Junction 2023
[Junction 2023](https://www.junction2023.com/) is a weekend-long hackathon, where participants team up and create tech projects to the challenges set by our partner companies. The projects can range from physical prototypes to new games, software, and concepts. With their projects, participants also compete for winning prizes on a challenge, as well as the Main Prize of 20,000â‚¬.

## Our project
Creating habits is really important, that's why we re imagined the current Huawei health app to make it attractive and satisfying for young people to do sports daily and weekly via a quests system with which everyone can compete and cooperate in order to get the most points across your friends.
