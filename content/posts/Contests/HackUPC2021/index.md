## About HackUPC
[HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/) is the first student hackathon in Spain. Once a year, we aim to provide a space for students of all experience levels from all around the world where they can improve and learn new skills, meet awesome people, and overall have a great experience! This year's edition will be held in a hybrid format, meaning that you can come in person but also participate from home.

## Our project
[@miquelt9](https://github.com/miquelt9), [@JCasahuga](https://github.com/JCasahuga) and I decided to participate in this hackathon in the first year of the degree. We were just competing for fun and especially to learn new things. HackUPC is a hackathon that participants are free to choose their own theme. Neither of us knew how to make any kind of frontend, but [@JCasahuga](https://github.com/JCasahuga) and I had used [<i class="fa-brands fa-unity"></i>Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine, so we decided to develop a 2D game using it. After some brainstorming, we decided to make a space shooter.

All the struggles and more info can be found in [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/spaceshooter-5hi4of), the platform where we submitted our project. Right below there's a demo of our game, and don't forget to check out the project on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/spaceshooter-5hi4of) and the code on [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>Github](https://github.com/BernatBC/Coding-Competitions/tree/main/HackUPC2021).
