[{"categories":null,"contents":"The statement Long-Term Visual Object Tracking Benchmark is a dataset to benchmark object tracking algorithms. We were asked to implement four different algorithms. Two using tracking techniques, and two using recognition. For each technique, we had to implement one from scratch (an algorithm made for us) and another one extracted from the internet.\nGiven a series of frames and a bounding box corresponding to the object to track, the algorithm should follow the object. To evaluate the precision, we used the overlapping ratio between the computed bounding box and the optimal bounding box (which was given via a txt file).\nThe full statement is in the document below. Note that the statement is in Catalan.\nAlgorithms and methods The four algorithms are the following:\nTracking by histogram comparison The idea of this method is to find the most similar crop of the whole frame. To achieve it, we decided to compute the distance between the color histograms of both crops. Normalized color histograms are a 2D matrix where each cell represents an interval of color proportion from each component of RGB. One axis belongs to the red component, and the other one belongs to the green component. The blue component can be found by B = 1 - R - G.\nWe decided to use the Chi-squared distance between two histograms, as it is quite efficient and returns a pretty good value.\nObviously, this method is not efficient as it needs to compute 1280Ã—720 possible crops. We had to reduce the number of comparisons, sacrificing precision. The first optimization was to only look for crops near the position of the object from the last frame. We decided to only check for crops that overlapped the previous bounding box. We accomplished drastically reducing the number of comparisons, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough. The second optimization was about doing comparisons every certain number of pixels. For example, if we checked every 5 pixels, we would reduce the number of comparisons by 25 times. We found that we could afford to check more frequently on smaller bounding boxes, so the value of the interval is computed depending on the size.\nAs you can read in the report, this was the best tracking method, as it consistently tracked the object, even though sometimes the precision is not there. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s the second-best method after Recognition using Yolov8 trained by ourselves.\nTracking by SIFT and RANSAC The idea of this method is to find keypoints and their descriptors using the Harris corner detector and the Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) from both the crop of the object and the whole frame. After the keypoints and their descriptors are extracted, points are matched by distance, and we obtain the best matching using the Random sample consensus (RANSAC).\nThe results of this method weren\u0026rsquo;t what we expected. This was the one that performed the worst, and by quite a bit. We detected two major faults. The first one is that if the object is not detailed, we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find many keypoints, leading to a low number of matchings. RANSAC needs at least 3 pairs in order to compute the best matching. In some cases, even 3 pairs weren\u0026rsquo;t enough, so RANSAC could not return a matching. The other fault was if the background was detailed and weighted. The algorithm detected many points in the background, and the matching produced was always made in the starting position (the algorithm was matching the background but not the object).\nRecognition using Yolov8 We found a neural network named Yolov8, that could detect several objects in an image. This network includes 80 different types of objects that can be distinguished. We just used it, but then we had the issue that we had to filter the results obtained. We manually selected the type of object to detect, and in some cases, more than one instance was recognized. Likewise, we made the decision to select the object that had the greatest confidence level.\nThe results of this method were pretty good, but a little lower than Tracking by histogram comparison and Recognition using Yolov8 trained by ourselves. The main issue was that there were a couple objects that the network didn\u0026rsquo;t support, like fish and faces. Another issue found was not from the neural network; it was from our \u0026lsquo;selection method\u0026rsquo; when we detected multiple instances. An example could be found in the video Boxing2. We had to detect a certain boxer, and even though the network recognized it, it also recognized the opponent, and with a greater confidence level.\nRecognition using Yolov8 trained by ourselves In this method, we decided to train Yolov8 with our own dataset. The professor allowed us to \u0026ldquo;cheat\u0026rdquo;, and add crops of the videos in order to train the network. We added 5 crops from each object to detect to our neural network, and after some failures, we got a pretty good recognition network for our videos.\nObviously, the results were the best ones, but we have to consider that when using it in other samples, the results will not be the ones we got. This network is specifically trained to recognize objects from this dataset only.\nGetting Started Tracking by histogram comparison 1.

Open to students from all around the world, in this two-day hackathon you\u0026rsquo;ll work as a team to build a project. You\u0026rsquo;ll pick up new skills, try out new tech, and meet new people.\nThis is our sixth time running this event, and we\u0026rsquo;re excited to create a more inclusive and rewarding event for all. You can join us in-person, or online!\nOur project Inspiration When @alexland7219, @loparc, @miquelt9 and I discovered that a Shark Plushie was one of the prizes of the Hackaway we realized that the Hackathons UK needed a way to optimally distribute the shark flushies across the country.\nWhat it does You can create cities, with a number of sharks already on them, a number of sharks that they require and their name. Then you can link cities with roads choosing the gas spent of traveling by them. Last, but not least, you may select one or more cities to have a plushie van, with its own capacity for shark plushies, which will travel through, and only through, linked cities loading and unloading plushies in order to satisfy the demands of each city. When you have everything you want just press the Run button.\nHow we built it The graphical side of the project, and the one that the user sees, is made with Unity. The main algorithms and the search of an optimized solution is made with Metric-FF, using the Planning Domain Definition Langauge (PDDL). It uses A* to guide itself to the optimal solution. If finding such solution becomes algorithmically expensive, then the heuristic will change in a way that we will find an optimized solution, maybe not the most optimized, but it will get it in a reasonable amount of time. Finally, the communication between the graphical side and the PDDL one is made by C# code (how could be otherwise).\nChallenges we ran into We had problems related to the OS that was going to be used. Some code had to be remade to work with C# and Unity in order to work with Windows. Also, we had trouble with large number of cities and connections will were resolved using by decrementing the optimism of the heuristic function.\nAccomplishments that we\u0026rsquo;re proud of Mainly, we made it work! We found ourselves stuck several times during the project, finding new bugs. It is true that it is usually always the same process: you solve one bug, you get three more! But given the limited time we thought to ourselves, during the beginning of the night, that we may not get anything working at all. But, after all, we found our way through and with patience and hard work we ended up getting where we wanted. Such a relief.\nWhat we learned We have improved our c# coding skills and learned how to communicate Unity, c#, pdll and testing c++ files.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next for Plushistics We would like to not only expand Plushistics to new countries, but also make it playable.

It is not possible to always go directly from one base to another, we have a map (connected graph) that tells us which movements are possible.\nTo cover the needs of the settlements, they request both specialized personnel and supplies to a centralized hub. Each request is for a supply unit or a person, if you want more you can make several requests. This hub is in charge of planning the movements of the rovers from the base where they are parked, to pick up the supplies and the necessary personnel and finally to leave them in the place where the request has been made.

Each power plant is represented by coordinates in a map, the total production and the cost when it\u0026rsquo;s stopped and running. Each client is represented by coordinates in a map, the power consumed, the price it pays for each Mw and a compensation in the case he doesn\u0026rsquo;t get power. Also, power gets drained if the distance between a power plant and a client is farther than a certain value.\nThey ask us to solve the problem using Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing. We also have to study how each parameter in this algorithm varies the solution and the time efficiency.\nThe full statement is in the document below. Note that the statement is in Spanish.\nOur solution @alexland7219, @Loparc and I were allowed to use AIMA, a library where both algorithms are implemented. For each algorithm we had to determine the state representation, the initial state generation, the operands and the heuristic function. By trying and studying different options, we selected the following ideas:\nState Representation We chose to represent a state with an array of c positions, where c is the number of clients. Each position represents a client and each value the power plant which the client is assigned to (can be empty). This representation is enough, but we decided to store certain parameters, so the program can run faster. We added the benefit that solution has, and some parameters needed for the heuristic function (will be explained later).\nOperands As we need a set of operands that can reach any possible solution, we started using 3 operands: Assign, unassign and swap. Assign and unassign operators are self-explanatory. Assign sets a power plant to a client (can overwrite a previous power plant assigned). Unassign removes a power plant from a client. Swap operator switches two power plants between two clients. Of course, each time we have to apply an operator, we check if it\u0026rsquo;s possible to apply it.\nLater we found that the unassign operator was never used, so we decided to remove it. That made the execution time go down a couple of seconds.\nInitial State Generation We had to make two strategies to generate the initial state, so we can compare them later on the project. As there\u0026rsquo;s a type of clients that have to have a power plant, we decided to assign all clients of this kind to a power plant.\nThe first strategy is to assign each \u0026ldquo;guaranteed\u0026rdquo; client to the closest power plant. The second one is also to assign each \u0026ldquo;guaranteed\u0026rdquo; client to a random power plant. There are cases where the initial state is not a valid solution, so we indicate to the heuristic function how many \u0026ldquo;guaranteed\u0026rdquo; clients don\u0026rsquo;t have a power plant assigned.\nHeuristic Function Our first guess was to use the benefit as the heuristic function. This worked fairy well until we noticed that the algorithm shut down all power plants. A better option would be to provide energy to as many clients as possible. After testing a lot of functions, we got\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; h = (dist * \\log(dist) + energy) *(nonAssignedG + 1) \\newline \u0026amp; dist = \\sum_{n=1}^{numPowerPlants}\\sum_{m=1}^{numClients} \\begin{cases} distance(powerPlants[n], clients[m]) \u0026amp;\\text{if } assigned(powerPlants[n], clients[m]) \\newline 0 \u0026amp;\\text{else } \\end{cases} \\newline \u0026amp; energy = \\sum_{n=1}^{numPowerPlants} powerPlants[n].energyLeftÂ² \\newline \u0026amp; where, \\newline \u0026amp; powerPlants[] \\to \\text{an array containing power plants} \\newline \u0026amp; clients[] \\to \\text{an array containing clients} \\newline \u0026amp; numPowerPlants \\to \\text{number of power plants} \\newline \u0026amp; numClients \\to \\text{number of clients} \\newline \u0026amp; energyLeft \\to \\text{energy the specified power plant has available} \\end{aligned} $$\nView Code and report on Github ","date":"October 24, 2022","hero":"/posts/education/localsearch/hero.png","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/education/localsearch/","summary":"The statement Given a set of Power plants and Clients, find an assignation for each Client where the total benefit is the maximum.

During 4 hours, the contestants try to solve as many coding problems as possible. A rank is made considering the number of solved problems and penalization points. For each wrong submission, they add 20 minutes to the total of time used for each solved problem. So the sooner you solve them, the better.\nAll 9 problems given are in the document below:\nMy submissions After reading all 9 problems, I decided to start with the last one as it was the easiest. It consisted of comparing two numbers, but with a twist. A number could have up to 10k digits. Because of the rush, I didn\u0026rsquo;t read this last part well and compared to Integers. I sent it, and I got a Wrong Answer. After reading it again, I understood well the problem and made the comparison using strings.\nThen I decided to try the problem number 2 in the list, which the goal was to simulate Snakes and Ladders table game. This one was straightforward to make, but a single number made me send an incorrect submission. I assigned a ladder to a wrong cell and after this fix I got it correct.\nI carried on with the fourth problem. Given a number sequence, we\u0026rsquo;d to output the maximum difference between the average and the median when excluding a number of the sequence. My first approach consisted of calculating for each sequence (after excluding each number) the median and the average. This approach gave the correct answer, but it failed, it was too inefficient. My second approach was to calculate the average one time and subtracting the \u0026lsquo;average value\u0026rsquo; for each number. After this optimization, I got the problem correct.\nThe last problem that I could solve was number 7. The goal was to count the number of arithmetic derivatives contained into a given interval. My first approach was to solve it using recursion, and worked. But once again it wasn\u0026rsquo;t efficient. After making some tests, I encountered that arithmetic derivatives follow a pattern. A number is an arithmetic derivative if it equals to a prime number powered to itself. So my second approach was just calculating the arithmetic derivatives from each prime number and checking if it follows inside the interval.\nAmong these four problems, I tried to solve two more. The eight problem consisted of implementing a data structure to insert, erase and reset strings. It also had to count the number of strings contained into in that contained a given suffix. I made it using sets, but once again it was inefficient. After the competition, some students said that they solved using trees. The third problem consisted of painting every node from a tree either blue or red. Painting in blue costs 1 per node, while painting in red costs 2 per node. The goal was to minimize the total cost of painting the tree. There is just one restriction: Each node can have, at most, one adjacent node with the same color as itself. Once again, I read the statement too fast and solved the problem without considering the restriction. I tried to apply the restriction, but I ran out of time.\nAt the end I got 4 problems right with a penalization time of 545 (including wrong submissions). I placed 16th out of 74 participants, and 13th out of 55 UPC students.\nYou can check the full rankings here.\nView Code on Github ","date":"June 15, 2022","hero":"/posts/competitions/20concursupc/hero.png","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/20concursupc/","summary":"About the contest Each year, School of Mathematics and Statistics from Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya organizes a coding competition for all students enrolled to UPC.

Minesweeper was a good candidate as it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too complex. I didn\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and made a clone of minesweeper.\nHow it works Basically I defined a matrix with a fixed size and with the help of a random number generator, mines are placed randomly across the board. Each cell has some parameters like a boolean to check if it has a flag, if it\u0026rsquo;s opened, an integer that determines the number of mines next to it, etc. Each state of the cell has its own sprite. When the game detects a mouse click in a cell, the game updates the cell state and shows a new sprite corresponding to its new state. This was the most complex part of this project, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too hard. To open the adjacent cells when there\u0026rsquo;s no mine in a cell, I made a dfs algorithm.\nView Code on Github for Windows 64bit ","date":"February 11, 2022","hero":"/posts/videogames/minesweeper/hero.png","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/","summary":"The project Before making this project, I\u0026rsquo;d used Unity game engine for making a couple of games like Tetris by following some Youtube tutorials.

Each round brings new challenges, and in the end 25 contestants will have the ultimate chance to put their skills to the test, vying for cash prizes and the coveted championship title at the World Finals.\nMy submissions I started with the first problem. The goal was to compute the cost of applying reversort to a sequence of numbers. I just implemented the reversort algorithm and calculate the overall cost.\nThe second one, given a sequence of \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;J\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;?\u0026rsquo;, and two values representing the cost of having CJ and JC on the sequence, we had to compute the minimum cost of the sequence when replacing the question mark for Cs or Js. My first attempt was to calculate every single possible sequence, but it was too slow. Afterwards, I noticed that by putting the same character as the front one or the behind one, you always get the minimum cost.\nThe third problem was related to the first one. We had to give the result of reversort after a given sequence size and number of iterations. I just used the first problem file and added some modifications. It worked well without any struggles.\nI found the fourth problem very challenging. After given an array size and a number of questions, we had to make a median sort but with a twist. We had to guess the initial order of the sequence by asking out of three numbers what the median was. I spent hours writing in my notebook all kinds of possibilities, and finally I got an algorithm that kind of solved the problem. It uses a lot of questions and sometimes repeats itself. But at least I got some points in that problem.\nI ended so exhausted from the fourth problem, I was running out of time and it seemed so difficult that I decided not to solve the fifth problem.\nSubmissions of all problems can be checked here.\nAt the end, I got 59/100 points after 25h and 37 minutes of time penalization.

At first, we tackled the problem by counting the potential number of cars that had to go through each traffic light and assigning greater slots of time to those that had more traffic. We were running out of time and compilation errors and several bugs were flourishing. At that time, @miquelt9 had a great idea to submit a solution where all traffic lights had the same duration.
