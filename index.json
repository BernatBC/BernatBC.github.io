The cash flow of each player it is pretty easy to implement. The jail cell has given me headaches with the go to jail movement and several bugs I\u0026rsquo;ve already fixed. Houses and hotels were also very buggy, especially when you selled them. I also had troubles implementing the functionality of some Chance and Community Chest cards as I had to change the way I made some functions. With the functionality of mortgages/unmortgages I learnt to access to a child object parameter in Unity. It\u0026rsquo;s a little different than on most common programming languages. Be in mind that now you can have negative cash due to testing.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? I still have to implement the fundamental mechanich, trading. Actions will also be implemented in the future. Finally I will make the UI as it deserves. Now it\u0026rsquo;s just a couple of text boxes and buttons.

During 4 hours the contestants try to solve as many coding problems as possible. A rank is made considering the number of solved problems and penalization points. For each wrong submittion they add 20 minutes to the total of time used for each solved problem. So the sooner you solve them, the better.\nAll 9 problems given are in the document below:\nMy submittions After reading all 9 problems I decided to start with the last one as it was the easiest. It consisted of comparing two numbers, but with a twist. A number could have up to 10k digits. Because of the rush I didn\u0026rsquo;t read this last part well and compared to Integers. I sent it, and I got a Wrong Answer. After reading it again, I understood well problem and made the comparison using strings.\nThen I decided to try the problem number 2 in the list, which the goal was to simulate Snakes and Ladders table game. This one was strightforward to make, but a single number made me send an incorrect sumbittion. I assigned a ladder to a wrong cell and after this fix I got it correct.\nI carried on with the fourth problem. Given a number sequence, we\u0026rsquo;d to output the maximum difference between the average and the median when excluding a number of the sequence. My first aproach consisted to calculate for each sequence (after excluding each number) the median and the average. This approach gave the correct answer but it failed it was too inefficient. My second aproach was to calculate the average one time and subbtracting the \u0026lsquo;average value\u0026rsquo; for each number. After this optimization I got the problem correct.\nThe last problem that I could solve was number 7. The goal was to count the number of arithmetic derivatives contained into a given interval. My first aproach was to solve it using recursivity and worked. But once again it wasn\u0026rsquo;t efficient. After making some tests I encountered that arithmetic derivatives follow a pattern. A number is an arithmetic derivative if it equals to a prime number powered to itself. So my second aproach was just calculating the arithmetic derivatives from each prime number and checking if it follows inside the interval.\nAmong these four problems I tried to solve two more. The eight problem consisted to implement a data structure to insert, erase and reset strings. It also had to count the number of strings contained into in that contained a given suffix. I made it using sets, but once again it was inefficient. After the competition some students said that they solved using trees. The third problem consisted to paint every node from a tree either blue or red. Painting in blue costs 1 per node, while painting in red costs 2 per node.The goal was to minimize the total cost of painting the tree. There is just one restriction: Each node can have, at most, one adjacent node with the same color than itself. Once again I read the statement too fast and solved the problem without considering the restriction. I tried to apply the restriction but I ran out of time.\nAt the end I got 4 problems right with a penalization time of 545 (including wrong sumbittions). I placed 16th out of 74 participants, and 13th out of 55 UPC students.\nYou can chech the full rankings here.\nView Code on Github ","date":"June 15, 2022","hero":"/posts/competitions/20concursupc/concursUPC.png","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/20concursupc/","summary":"About the contest Each year School of Mathematics and Statistics from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya organizes a coding competition for all students enrolled to UPC.

So the sooner you solve them, the better.","tags":["C++","Competition"],"title":"Vintè Concurs de Programació de la UPC - Semifinal 2022"},{"categories":null,"contents":"About Google Hash Code Google Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. It allows you to share your skills and connect with other coders as you work together to solve a problem modeled off a real Google engineering challenge! In small teams of two to four, coders all over the world will tackle the first problem through Qualification Round. Though this round is hosted online, teams can come together virtually to compete side-by-side in locally coordinated Hash Code Hubs. The top teams from this round are invited to join us for the virtual World Finals.\nThe problem You are given a list of contributors, who have already mastered various skills, and a list of projects with different skill requirements. Contributors can improve their skills by completing projects and can mentor each other to work is roles in which they couldn\u0026rsquo;t succeed on their own. Your task is to assign contributors to project roles that fit their qualifications and maximize the score for completed projects.\nFor more details please check the problem statement.\nOur submission The team was composed with @miquelt9, @alexland7219 and myself, three friends studying Computer Science at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. After some brainstorming we decided to attempt to fill the first project available with lowest skilled contribuitors. As soon a project has finalized the contribuitors are assigned to the first project available that they can fit in. After some debugging we decided to generate our submittion files. Little did we know that they were taking forever. We were the three of us using 100% of our CPUs and waiting for the last minute to submit the files. Luckily when submitting partial files, score is still computed. At the end we ended with partial sumbitions.\nYou can check our algorithm alongside the submittion files in my Github repository.\nIn the end with our partial submittion we obtained 1,477,643 points positioning ourselves in 3259 out of 10100-10200, a little better than in 2021.\nYou can chech the full rankings here.\nView Code on Github ","date":"February 24, 2022","hero":"/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/hash2022.jpg","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/","summary":"About Google Hash Code Google Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world.

Also I made Space Shooter during HackUPC2021 but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t on my own. Now I wanted to do a project on my own and decided to start with a simple game. Minesweeper was a good candidate as it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too complex. I didn\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and made a clone of minesweeper.\nHow it works Basically I defined a matrix with a fixed size and with the help of a random number generator, mines are placed randomly across the board. Each cell has some parameters like a boolean to check if it has a flag, if it\u0026rsquo;s opened, an integer that determines the number of mines next to it, etc. Each state of the cell has its own sprite. When the game detects a mouse click in a cell the game updates the cell state and shows a new sprite corresponding to its new state. The most complex part of this project it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too hard. To open the adjacent cells when there\u0026rsquo;s no mine in a cell I made a dfs algorithm.\nView Code on Github for Windows 64bit ","date":"February 11, 2022","hero":"/posts/videogames/minesweeper/Minesweeper.png","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/","summary":"The project Before making this project, I\u0026rsquo;d used Unity game engine for making a couple of games like tetris by following some youtube tutorials.

Once a year, we aim to provide a space for students of all experience levels from all around the world where they can improve and learn new skills, meet awesome people, and overall have a great experience! This year\u0026rsquo;s edition will be held in a hybrid format, meaning that you can come in person but also participate from home.\nOur project @miquelt9, @JCasahuga and myself decided to pariticipate in this hackaton in the first year of the degree. We were just competing for fun and especially to learn new things. HackUPC is a hackaton that participants are free to choose their own theme. Neither of us knew how to make any kind of frontend, but @JCasahuga and myself had used Unity game engine, so we decided to develop a 2D game using it. After some brain storming we decided to make a space shooter.\nAll the struggles and more info can be found in Devpost, the plattform were we submitted our project.

Contestants advance through four online-hosted rounds to compete at the annual Code Jam World Finals that is held at a different international Google office each year. Each round brings new challenges, and in the end 25 contestants will have the ultimate chance to put their skills to the test, vying for cash prizes and the coveted championship title at the World Finals.\nMy submittions I started with the first problem. The goal was to compute the cost of applying reversort to a sequence of numbers. I just implemented the reversort algorithm and calculate the overall cost.\nThe second one, given a sequence of \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;J\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;?\u0026rsquo;, and two values representing the cost of having CJ and JC on the sequence, we had to compute the minimum cost of the sequence when replacing the question mark for Cs or Js. My first attempt was to calculate every single possible sequence, but it was too slow. Afterwards I noticed that by putting the same character as the front one or the behind one, you always get the minimum cost.\nThe third problem it was related to the first one. We had to give the result of reversort after a given sequence size and number of iterations. I just used the first problem file and added some modifications. It worked well without any struggles.\nI found the fourth problem very challenging. After given an array size and a number of questions, we had to make a median sort but with a twist. We had to guess the initial order of the sequence by asking out of three numbers what the median was. I spent hours writting in my notebook all kinds of possibilities and finally I got an algorithm that kind of solved the problem. It uses a lot of questions and sometimes repeats itself. But at least I got some points in that problem.\nI ended so exhausted from the fourth problem, I was running out of time and it seemed so difficult that I decided not to solve the fifth problem.\nSubmittions of all problems can be checked here.\nAt the end I got 59/100 points after 25h and 37minutes of time penalization. I ranked 5773rd out of 37000-38000 participants.\nYou can chech the full rankings here.\nView Code on Github ","date":"March 27, 2021","hero":"/posts/competitions/codejam2021/codejam.png","permalink":"https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/competitions/codejam2021/","summary":"About Google Code Jam Google’s longest running global coding competition, Google Code Jam, calls on programmers around the world to solve challenging, algorithmic puzzles against the clock.

At first we tackled the problem counting the potential number of cars that had to go through each traffic light and assigning greater slots of time to those that had more traffic. We were running out of time and compilation errors and several bugs were flourishing. At that time, @miquelt9 had a great idea to submit a solution where all traffic lights had the same duration. This was a simple solution, definetly worse than the first one but it saved the day!\nYou can check both algorithms programs alongside the submittion files in my Github repository.\nIn the end with our simple submittion we obtained 7,886,739 points positioning ourselves in 4432 out of 9004.
