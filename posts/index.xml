&lt;p>Since the arrival of the photographic camera, humans have seen the need to find a way to organize photographs. Nowadays, the ease and simplicity of taking a photograph causes large quantities of them to accumulate. The most popular photo viewers and galleries display one image after another, in a list or grid, making it difficult to organize and searching them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Junction 2023</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/contests/junction2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/contests/junction2023/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-junction-2023">About Junction 2023&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC)&lt;/a> is an annual team-based programming competition aimed at university and college students from the Nordic and Baltic countries. NCPC is suitable for programmers of all skill levels, from beginner to expert. The contest features a well-rounded problem set with a mix of easy and challenging problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Teams are allowed only one computer, and are not allowed to surf through the internet.&lt;/p>

&lt;br />
Once I read this problem, I directly went to code it in the computer as it seemed easy. I coded the usual roman to decimal converter, but then I noticed that they asked for a simpler version of the problem: &amp;ldquo;we will subtract any digit written to the left of a larger digit, even if they are not directly adjacent.&amp;rdquo; making the problem easier. I had a couple of little issues with the slight modification of the problem, but eventually I managed to solve it. This was the first problem we managed to get it right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Object Tracker</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/objecttracker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/objecttracker/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-statement">The statement&lt;/h2>

&lt;a href="https://amoudgl.github.io/tlp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long-Term Visual Object Tracking Benchmark&lt;/a> is a dataset to benchmark object tracking algorithms. We were asked to implement four different algorithms. Two using tracking techniques, and two using recognition. For each technique, we had to implement one from scratch (an algorithm made for us) and another one extracted from the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given a series of frames and a bounding box corresponding to the object to track, the algorithm should follow the object. To evaluate the precision, we used the overlapping ratio between the computed bounding box and the optimal bounding box (which was given via a txt file).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>λ-Calculus Telegram Bot</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-statement">The statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We were asked to make a lambda-calculus interpreter created by

This interpreter had also to support the definition and use of macros, a variable name for another expression. Those macros had to be evaluated in an infix (if it&amp;rsquo;s a symbol) or a prefix mode (otherwise). On top of that, our interpreter had to run in a
&lt;a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram&lt;/a> chat. Finally, we had to add the capability to print our expression as a tree in an image.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Royal Hackaway v6</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/contests/royalhackawayv6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/contests/royalhackawayv6/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-royal-hackaway">About Royal Hackaway&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The &lt;em>Programming Projects&lt;/em> college subject asked us to create an application to manage documents using Java. This application has to feature the creation of a document, importing and exporting files in three different formats: plaintext, XML and our own format. The application also has to have the ability to delete and modify these documents. The main feature of the application is the various document queries that allow us to find a certain document or author in the application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planification project</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/planification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/planification/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-statement">The statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are in the year 2075 and the first colonizers of Mars have established a network of bases throughout the geography of the planet that can be of two types, settlements (where the settlers live) and warehouses (where supplies arrive from the Earth). Moving between these bases is done by rovers that can move supplies and specialized personnel. It is not possible to always go directly from one base to another, we have a map (connected graph) that tells us which movements are possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Knowledge Based Systems</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/knowledgebasedsystems/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-statement">The statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The progressive aging of the population is showing the importance of maintaining a set of healthy habits and promote physical exercise throughout life. When you reach a certain age it is necessary to have help to determine what types of exercises and activities are the most appropriate taking into account all factors that may affect the performance of those activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, we had to make a
&lt;a href="https://clipsrules.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLIPS&lt;/a> script that after given certain information about a person, we had to output an exercise planning suitable for him/her. We were given a bunch of documents about exercises for elder people where we had to extract the information.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Europoly</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/videogames/europoly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 06:00:22 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/videogames/europoly/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:55.66%; zoom: 0.6;

&lt;p>After making the
&lt;a href="https://bernatbc.me/posts/videogames/minesweeper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minesweeper&lt;/a>, I wanted to create something more elaborated. I decided to make a clone of Monopoly. Almost everybody has played at least one time to Monopoly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to make an introduction.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I started with the player movement and the dice. When everything was smooth and playable, I started to make the cards. One thing I like about them is the fact that they aren&amp;rsquo;t images. Cards are rendered based in the info assigned to its cell. With this method I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be hours making each card, and if I want to change a value, I just do it once and the card will change automatically. The cash flow of each player is pretty easy to implement. The jail cell has given me headaches with the go to jail movement and several bugs I&amp;rsquo;ve already fixed. Houses and hotels were also very buggy, especially when you sold them. I also had troubles implementing the functionality of some Chance and Community Chest cards, as I had to change the way I made some functions. With the functionality of mortgages/unmortgages I learnt to access to a child object parameter in Unity. It&amp;rsquo;s a little different from most common programming languages. Be in mind that now you can have negative cash due to testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Local Search</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/education/localsearch/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-statement">The statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given a set of Power plants and Clients, find an assignation for each Client where the total benefit is the maximum. Each power plant is represented by coordinates in a map, the total production and the cost when it&amp;rsquo;s stopped and running. Each client is represented by coordinates in a map, the power consumed, the price it pays for each Mw and a compensation in the case he doesn&amp;rsquo;t get power. Also, power gets drained if the distance between a power plant and a client is farther than a certain value.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vintè Concurs de Programació de la UPC - Semifinal 2022</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/contests/20concursupc/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.me/posts/contests/20concursupc/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-the-contest">About the contest&lt;/h2>
