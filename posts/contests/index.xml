&lt;p>Creating habits is really important, that&amp;rsquo;s why we re imagined the current Huawei health app to make it attractive and satisfying for young people to do sports daily and weekly via a quests system with which everyone can compete and cooperate in order to get the most points across your friends.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest 2023</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/contests/ncpc2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/contests/ncpc2023/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-ncpc-2023">About NCPC 2023&lt;/h2>

&lt;a href="https://ncpc23.kattis.com/contests/ncpc23/problems/convertingromans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statement of Problem C: Converting Romans&lt;/a>
&lt;br />
Once I read this problem, I directly went to code it in the computer as it seemed easy. I coded the usual roman to decimal converter, but then I noticed that they asked for a simpler version of the problem: &amp;ldquo;we will subtract any digit written to the left of a larger digit, even if they are not directly adjacent.&amp;rdquo; making the problem easier. I had a couple of little issues with the slight modification of the problem, but eventually I managed to solve it. This was the first problem we managed to get it right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Royal Hackaway v6</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/contests/royalhackawayv6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/contests/royalhackawayv6/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-royal-hackaway">About Royal Hackaway&lt;/h2>

&lt;a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UPC&lt;/a>. During 4 hours, the contestants try to solve as many coding problems as possible. A rank is made considering the number of solved problems and penalization points. For each wrong submission, they add 20 minutes to the total of time used for each solved problem. So the sooner you solve them, the better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2022</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/contests/hashcode2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/contests/hashcode2022/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="about-google-hash-code">About Google Hash Code&lt;/h2>
