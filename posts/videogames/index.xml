I decided to make a clone of Monopoly. Almost everybody has played at least one time to monolpoly, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to make an introduction.
How it works I started with the player movement and the dice. When everything was smooth and playable I started to make the cards. One thing I like about them is the fact that they aren&amp;rsquo;t images.</description></item><item><title>Minesweeper</title><link>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://www.bernatbc.tk/posts/videogames/minesweeper/</guid><description>The project Before making this project, I&amp;rsquo;d used Unity game engine for making a couple of games like tetris by following some youtube tutorials. Also I made Space Shooter during HackUPC2021 but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t on my own. Now I wanted to do a project on my own and decided to start with a simple game. Minesweeper was a good candidate as it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too complex. I didn&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and made a clone of minesweeper.</description></item></channel></rss>
